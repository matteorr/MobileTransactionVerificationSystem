 * The Mobile Transaction Verification System C++ Demo simulates an attack by a Man in the Middle to a transaction between a 
 * client and a server program. The oob client application allows to detect wether a transaction has been changed in any of its
 * content and to accept it or reject it. The authentication functions are based on SHA-1 secure hash function.
 *
 * To run the demo start the executable files in the following order:
 *
 * - ./serverMain
 * - ./mitmMain
 * - ./clientMain
 * - ./oobClientMain
